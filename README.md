# ATM Exercise

### Description

This program allows users to deposit and withdraw money from an ATM machine, and keeps track of the account balance. The program includes a drop down menu from which the user can select deposit or withdrawal. When selected, a number input box appears along with a submit button that can be used to input an amount into the account. If the input is negative or if the user is trying to withdraw more money than is in the account, the submit button is disabled to not allow for the transaction to occur. 

### How to Run

1. Download the zip file in github and navigate to the **ATM-Exercise-main** directory in the terminal.
2. Run `http-server -c-1`.
3. When that is complete, load **localhost:8080** in the browser and click on the link for **index.html**. This will load the project in the browser.
4. Select an option in the drop down menu, type a number in the input box, and press submit to interact with the program.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements

- **Transaction History** I plan to add the functionality of the program logging each of the transactions in a transaction history that will appear as a list.
- **Styling** I plan to improve the styling of the components on the page to be more intuitive and look more professional.
